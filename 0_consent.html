        <p>Thank you for considering participating in this research study.
        </p>
           
        <p><b>Purpose of the research: </b>
          To gain an understanding of user preferences when interacting with novel in-vehicle environments for future, highly-automated cars. Findings from this study will be used to inform the design of user interfaces for future highly-automated cars, which will allow users, for part of their ride - when automation is in full control, to engage in some work-related and wellbeing tasks, while prioritizing and maintaining safety.
        </p>

        <p><b>Time required: </b>The task will take approximately 40 minutes to complete.</p>
           
        <p><b>What you will do in this study: </b>If you decide to participate, we will show you a series of designs for a novel in-vehicle user interface, which supports work-related and wellbeing tasks, as well as safe driving. We will then ask you to show us (using video or audio recording) how you’d interact with such an in-car environment that combines augmented reality user-interface using voice, gestures, and tangible input. We will also ask for your preference. 
        After the task is completed, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your experience.
        </p>
           
        <p><b>Benefits: </b>Participants will benefit from learning about design possibilities for the future of work in cars and reflecting on their own preferences for interacting with autonomous vehicles and contribute to a research project with the goal of informing the design of future in-car user interfaces that support safe-driving, as well as increased productivity and wellbeing.</p>

        <p><b>Risks: </b>The risks of participating in this study are minimal, equivalent to using a computer or phone. Participant’s will have to allow camera access in order to record their responses. Participant’s recorded data is not connected with any identifying information. The response data will be stored on a secure server that is owned and managed by Wellesley College technology team.</p>

        <p><b>Compensation: </b>You will be compensated for your time with $7 through the Prolific website.</p>

        <p><b>Confidentiality: </b>Your video and audio recordings as well as your responses to the questionnaire will be kept strictly confidential. All data collected will be saved on a secure server. When research results are reported, responses will be aggregated (added together) and described in summary.</p>

        <p><b>Participation and withdrawal: </b>Your participation is completely voluntary. To receive compensation, all tasks in the study must be completed. You may quit at any time, but if you choose to exit the survey you will not receive compensation. Should you choose to quit, none of your information will be used.</p>

        <p><b>To Contact the Researcher: </b>If you have any questions or concerns about this study, you can contact the primary investigator, Orit Shaer, at oshaer@wellesley.edu.</p>

        <p>If you have questions about your rights as a research subject you can contact Melissa McGee in UNH Research Integrity Services at 603-862-2005 or melissa.mcgee@unh.edu to discuss them.</p>
        
        <p>I have read the description of the study and voluntarily consent to participate. I understand that I may discontinue participation in this study at any time without any penalty and that there are no risks associated with this study. I have been given a copy of this consent form.</p>

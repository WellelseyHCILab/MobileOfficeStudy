        <p>Thank you for considering participating in this research study.
        </p>
           
        <p><b>Purpose of the research: </b>
          To gain an understanding of user preferences when interacting with novel in-vehicle environments for future, highly-automated cars. Findings from this study will be used to inform the design of user interfaces for future highly-automated cars, which will allow users, for part of their ride - when automation is in full control, to engage in some work-related and wellbeing tasks, while prioritizing and maintaining safety.
        </p>

        <p><b>Time required: </b>The task will take approximately 40 minutes to complete.</p>
           
        <p><b>What you will do in this study: </b>If you decide to participate, we will show you a series of designs for a novel in-vehicle user interface, which supports work-related and wellbeing tasks, as well as safe driving. We will then ask you to show us (using video or audio recording) how youâ€™d interact with such an in-car environment that combines augmented reality user-interface using voice, gestures, and tangible input. We will also ask for your preference. 
        After the task is completed, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your experience.
        </p>
           
        <p><b>Benefits: </b>Contribute to a research project with the goal of informing the design of future in-car user interfaces that support safe-driving, as well as increased productivity and wellbeing.</p>

        <p><b>Risks: </b>There are no known risks associated with participating in this research.</p>

        <p><b>Compensation: </b>You will be compensated for your time with $10.</p>

        <p><b>Confidentiality: </b>Your video and audio recordings as well as your responses to the questionnaire will be kept strictly confidential. All data collected will be saved on a secure server. When research results are reported, responses will be aggregated (added together) and described in summary.</p>

        <p><b>Participation and withdrawal: </b>Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may quit at any time without penalty. Exit the survey as needed. None of your information will be used should you choose to quit.</p>
